# Welcome 

Welcome to the SnowConvert for Spark lab for TechUP!

In this lab you will learn the following:
- How to access and run the tool
- What to look for in the input source code to ensure a quality output
- How to interpret the output reports
- When to reach out to the FCTO and WLS/PS team

The SnowConvert for Spark assessment gives as accurate account of references to the Spark API that can be converted to the Snowpark API. This will give you insight into how "ready" a Spark workload is for Snowflake, but note that this is merely a first impression and other factors will need to be considered including the presence of customer third parties libraries that may not compenents not yet supported in Snowflake.

# Prerequisite

To get started, you can actually take care of the first bullet above (How to access and run the tool) prior to starting this lab. Review the [presentation shared in the Spark Attack Compass page](https://snowflake.seismic.com/app#/doccenter/1bd9d0ff-73e0-4b73-adc8-41c72dada8f3/doc/%252Fdd0c30a4a2-c03e-816f-fef3-3f9c02aeec2c%252FdfYTBiNWYyNGUtMDRhMC00YTg5LTgwODAtNTI5MTg5YWFhNWVj%252CPT0%253D%252CU3BhcmsgQXR0YWNr%252Flf6168eb8d-4366-4d2d-8015-1b30e65f50ff//?mode=view). 
This will give you access to the tool and a preliminary understanding of waht will be covered in this lab.

# Resources

## Codebases
There are two codebases that this lab will explore. The first represents a "good candidate for migration". The second represents a workload that might requires some extra analysis. How to deal with each of these codebases can be found in the document linked above. Download each directory present in this section of this course and follow the instructions in the walkthrough linked above.

## Walkthrough 
The walkthrough for this lab is where you will spend most of your time. It is available in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r1eahnIdWT2jzOoCHUYgYIAFYR_DN6r01WfYaOLY0aw/edit?usp=sharing 

Follow along with the instructions in the document above. You will spend the rest of this lab there.
